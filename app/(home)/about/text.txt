ABOUT US

Our Vision
To redefine beauty through nature — creating products that heal, grow, and glow. Revival Glow is built on the belief that confidence starts with care, and care begins with what you put on your body. We’re not just a haircare brand — we’re a movement toward clean, conscious beauty.

Our Story
Revival Glow was born out of frustration and faith. After years of dealing with breakage, thinning edges, and the disappointment of harsh, chemical-heavy products, our founder decided to change the narrative.

“I was tired of my hair always breaking and my edges cutting off. I wanted to be proud of my natural hair again — not just hide it.”—-FOUNDER

As a braider, she saw countless clients struggle with the same problem — using product after product with no visible results. That’s when the idea of Revival Glow was born: to create something different. Something real. A product that actually works and helps people feel confident in their natural beauty again.

With the help of Ayurvedic experts and natural formulation partners, Roote Hair Growth Oil was created — the first step toward restoring not just hair, but self-trust and glow.
